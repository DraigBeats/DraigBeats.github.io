# We're back! ?!

**Our first event last year was such an incredible success that we couldn't resist to do it again!**

Our mission remains the same: raising money for our dear friend and colleague Dr Sophie Williams. But this time we will share a portion with Treborth Botanic Garden as a thank you for their deep support, without which ther would'nt be a Festival. It is widely that Sophie has felt and still feels so passionately about Treborth Botanic Garden.

Draig Beats will be held on Saturday the 8th of June 2019 from 10am until 8pm in Treborth Botanic Garden. It’s a family friendly, fund raising event with plenty of live music, workshops, vegan food & drink and lots of activities to keep the kids busy!

We are trying to keep ticket prices to a minimum but still aim to raise as much money as possible to help support Sophie who still waits for approval of the NHS to live at home in North Wales following 4 years of intensive care, rehabilitation and placements in multiple care homes after contracting Japanese Encephalitis.

All profits from the food and bars and ticket sales will be going directly to the *Sophie Williams Trust* with a small proportion to the *Friends of Treborth Botanic Garden*. Sso please join us for a great day out and help us raise as much money as possible!

We have a great lineup of music and entertainment to announce over the coming weeks, so please keep checking back to the page and help spread the event amongst your friends.

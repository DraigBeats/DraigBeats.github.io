[TICKETS!]([https://ticketpass.org/event/EADYOA/draig-beats-festival-2025])<p>


**A family friendly, day long festival, to build bridges between the University and local Communities and to help Dr Sophie.**

Draig Beats will return on Saturday the **7th of June 2025** to Treborth Botanic Garden!

It is a family friendly, fund raising event, and will contribute to building bridges between the University and local communities. There will be on offer plenty of live music, talks, workshops, food & drink plus, showcasing local initiatives and lots of activities to keep the kids busy!

We are unpaid volunteers and are trying to keep ticket prices to a minimum but still aim to raise as much money as possible to help support our inspiring friend and colleague Dr Sophie Williams, a former lecturer in plant conservation at Bangor University. Unfortunately she still lives in a care home following years of stays on intensive care after contracting Japanese Encephalitis. The Pandemic didn't help to move her back in to her community and we're still fighting for her to live a life among her friends and colleagues.

Please join us for a great day out and help us raise as much money as possible!
